          <h4>The Program</h4>

          <p>The CS Scholars Program at UC Berkeley offers a "home" within Cal for
          diverse undeclared Letters and Science students interested in the
          computer science major. We aim to support students from underserved
          backgrounds who might not have had access to resources that prepare
          students to succeed in computer science.  We seek passionate, creative
          students who wish to give back to the community and to each other.</p>

          <h4>Collaborative Problem-Solvers, Innovators, Leaders</h4>

          <p>CS Scholars provides a cohesive environment where scholars commit to
          the success of one another.  Scholars benefit from a host of academic,
          leadership and professional development opportunities. For example,
          scholars attend required entry level computer science courses
          (specifically, CS 61A and 61B), labs, discussion sections as a cohort.
           They attend a special seminar devoted to academic success and career
          development.  Each Scholar works closely with the Associate Director
          for L&amp;S CS Undergraduate Matters in order to prepare for admission to
          the UC Berkeley Letters and Science Computer Science major.  Scholars
          also benefit from specialized tutoring, faculty mentoring, peer
          mentoring, a dedicated departmental study space and industry site
          visits.</p>

          <h4>Demographics</h4>

          <p>Following the lead of Berkeley's successful 
          <a href="http://bsp.berkeley.edu">Biology Scholars Program</a>,
          CS Scholars challenges the popular stereotypes about who
          can and should do computer science. In our first year:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>60%</b> of CS Scholars participants were women</li>
            <li><b>30%</b> were underrepresented minorities (African American,
              Latino, or Native American)</li>
            <li><b>41%</b> spoke a language other than English at home, and</li>
            <li><b>58%</b> will be the first in their family to graduate from a
              four-year college.</li>
          </ul>

          <img class="photo-m text-photo-left text-photo-top text-photo-no-bottom" src="/img/seminar-1.jpg" />

          <h4>Success</h4>

          <p>CS Scholars seeks to attract and retain more diverse students to a
          field that has long been challenged in terms of diversity. Because
          most of our members come from under-resourced high schools,
          economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and are the first in their
          families to attend college, that success may mean taking courses,
          doing research, and graduating on a "different clock" than their
          peers. CS Scholars helps students develop an individualized
          plan to get them where they want to go.</p>


          <p class="spaced">Our first year is already showing promising results.  Our first cohort
          had a <b>100%</b> completion rate for CS 61A (compared to 87% for the class
          overall) and maintained a higher GPA overall than the general class.</p>
