          ADOPT A COHORT<br>
          <br>

          We invite your organization to adopt a Cohort of CS Scholars.  This
          will allow you access to a talented pool of diverse, professional and
          collaborative computer scientists.  As a CS Scholars Cohort Partner,
          we will help you arrange a campus visit to meet with your cohort and
          will assist you in coordinating  site visits for your cohort to your
          site.  We will also help you locate possible interns through the
          program.  For more information, please see [LINK TO EECS FUNDRAISING
          PAGE].<br>
